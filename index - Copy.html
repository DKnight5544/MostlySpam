            <p class="para-header">A Promise Delivered</p>

            <p>
                On the cover of my book, Overcoming MLM, I promised you a way
                to make money sharing my book with anyone still talking to you.
                This it. Pay attention!
            </p>

            <p class="para-header">Full Transparency</p>

            <p>
                The only way you are gonna make money helping me promote my
                book is to hope that others will send it to you. I don't make
                enough on book sales to share it with you so I have created
                this chain letter instead.
            </p>

            <p class="para-header">Black Magic</p>

            <p>
                Right now you are probably feeling a strange compulsion to pull
                out your Cash App and send each of my spammers a $5 gift.  This
                would be because they are using the power of manifestation to
                attract your money for their own questionable purposes.
            </p>

            <p class="para-header">Call Upon St. Spamuel</p>

            <p>
                If you ever hope to see your money again, what you must do
                is add your Cash App $cashtag to my list of spammers, then
                you must share it with as many people as you can. Far and wide
                you must share it. If people still invite you to get togethers
                then you are not a true disciple of saint Spamuel.
            </p>

            <p class="para-header">Manifest It!</p>

            <p>
                As you share the page with your name on it, you will want
                to focus your energy on attracting what you want from the universe.
                Intentionallity is the key to Prosperity!  Know what you want.
                Set your mind on it.  Speak the words "give me the digital cash!" into
                the ether!
            </p>

            <p class="para-header">Another Way</p>

            <p>
                A harder, blander, tasteless, way exists for you to make
                money promoting my book. You can become an amazon associate
                and share an affiliate link with others and earn a small
                comission on every sale you generate.  Meh. Look it up.
            </p>

            <p>
                Before you start pestering your friends into oblivion, take a second
                to click on the banner below to check out my book on Amazon.

            <p class="para-header"></p>

            <p>
                It is the perfect gag-gift for the schemer in your life so buy a copy
                or five today so you are ready the next time you get an invitation
                to a Tupperware Party!
